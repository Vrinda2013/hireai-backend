Reseach Paper
As part of my MSc in AI, I conducted 
research titled "Intelligent Traffic 
Signal Control using AI: A Machine 
Learning Approach." The study 
focused on optimizing traffic signals 
using machine learning to reduce 
congestion and improve flow. I 
designed predictive models and 
implemented AI-based adaptive 
signal timing, demonstrating 
significant reductions in traffic delays 
during simulations.
